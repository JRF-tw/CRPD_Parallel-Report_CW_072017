## Article 11: Dangerous Situations and Humanitarian Emergencies

<ol start="95">
  <li>In response to the Paragraphs 70 and 73 of the State Report: The State Report does not concretely address how to provide assistance in disseminating key information to persons with different types of disabilities on disaster relief, evacuation, and during emergencies. For example, guides can use signs and/or flashing lights to assist persons with hearing disabilities. We would like the Government to explain how the current “Disaster Prevention and Protection Act” accounts for the varying needs of persons with different disabilities in disaster relief and rescue exercises to ensure the protection of persons with disabilities (PWDs) during emergencies.</li>
</ol>

### Incomplete disaster relief system may endanger people with disabilities who depend on electrically powered devices (in response to Paragraphs 71 and 73 of the State Report)

<ol start="96">
  <li>Doubts in the capability of the decentralized notification mechanism of each county and municipal government to respond to emergency: According to the “Table on County- and Municipal-level Communication Windows for Handling Issues Relating to Persons on Electrical Breathing Assistance during Blackouts” published by the Social Assistance and Social Work Department of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, section chiefs, section members, or even contracted personnel are responsible for providing frontline disaster information in twelve counties and municipalities. This is contrary to the stipulation that police departments, fire departments, and township and neighborhood chiefs or their staff take responsibility for such tasks under Article 30 of the “Disaster Prevention and Protection Act.” The response ability of these communication windows during the chaos of blackouts, communication breakdowns, and severe weather during non-office hours are consequently of concern.</li>

  <li>The Government is unable to guarantee supply of emergency electricity provision systems in-residence, forcing PWDs on life support systems to evacuate to hospitals to escape from disasters: According to 2015 statistics from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, there are 8,784 families with PWDs that depend on breathing machines, oxygen producing machines, phlegm removing machines, or similar equipment to sustain life. The Ministry of Health and Welfare has established a list of individuals who are in need of secured reserve electrical generators, and created an “Emergency Rescue and Repair Request Agreement” template to facilitate the emergency procurement of equipment during disaster relief. However, when Taipei City and some other counties and municipalities received emergency notices, they do not follow Ministry of Health and Welfare plans in delivering electricity generators to the homes of individuals on the list. Instead, they dispatch ambulances during severe weather to send the PWDs who need life sustaining machines but have no other medical needs to the hospital emergency rooms simply in order to ensure access to electricity.</li>

  <li>Consequently, we ask the government to:

    <ol>
      <li>Ensure a standardized disaster reporting and handling mechanism between central and local governments are properly implemented: During emergency events, PWDs, primary caregivers, and all local township and neighborhood heads should be able to notify the crisis response center of their situations through police and fire department units, and activate central and regional disaster rescue and relief plans.</li>

      <li>“Emergency Electrical Supply System for Life Support Equipment” should be included in central and local disaster rescue and relief plans, with demands for implementation by responsible government agencies. Such efforts should include: establishing a name list (of PWD households that use electrical life support equipment), stockpiling small electricity generators and diesel fuel, completing contracts for emergency rescue and repair templates during disasters. The Government should further compile statistics and release reports on care for PWD users of life support systems during unexpected stoppages of electrical supply during disasters and emergencies.</li>
