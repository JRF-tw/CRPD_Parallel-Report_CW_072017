### Disabled Children's Rights Advocacy Alliance in Taiwan （DCRAAT）

They are absent from the game fields in the park because of the disability unfriendliness of the facilities. They disappear from the playgrounds on campuses because of the poor quality of inclusive education. They are invisible to us because of the denial of transportation and basic public utilities. Their needs have long been disregarded. They lose the equal enjoyment of all rights and support all children  deserve, and also across the entire course of lives. DCRAAT is dedicated to actively monitoring the government, participating in relevant policy-making to ensure the children with disability have equal access with other children to fully participate in school, recreation activities and all other aspects of life.

### Hand Angel

Hand Angel is a Taiwan-based organization advocating the practice of sex rights. We see the importance of sex to individual people, and how the desires of people with severe physical disabilities are confined by the limited mobility and traditional values in Taiwan. Therefore, we formed the first volunteer organization Hand Angel in Taiwan, providing sex service for people with disability in early 2013. We look forward to setting free the desires of people with physical disabilities.

Our goal is to change the norm in Taiwan’s charity which satisfies the general public, yet sacrifices those with disabilities. Our belief is to treat everyone with equality through our services, deliberately revealing the hidden needs of people with physical disabilities to the government and the society. We insist that "the sex rights of the people with disabilities are their human rights!" Hand Angel seeks to provide a service that specializes in masturbation for people with physical disabilities, aiming to bring sexual gratification to the physical disabled so that they can gain a greater motivation to embrace their lives with disabilities. Hand Angel does not accept any donations, in order to show that even if prostitution is legalized in Taiwan one day, there are still people with severe disabilities who have very limited mobility to work or even walk out of the door to conduct sexual transactions.Hand Angel keeps offering services in the hope of advocating sex rights of the physical disabled to the general public in Taiwan, and incorporating the sex right perspectives to the relevant disability charity organizations’ services. Through speeches, interviews from the media, publication and cooperation with other NGOs, etc., we look forward to changing the lives of many with disabilities step by step.
