## Overview

<ol start="1">
  <li>Our government continues to view persons with disability through the lens of charity or medical treatment, often applying an attitude of “care, love, service” to address related issues. This fails to realize the meaning of “enabling persons with disability to enjoy the same foundation for rights as other people” under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (hereinafter “CRPD”). Not only is the government unable to advance policies that promote equal rights, but also ignores the participation of persons with disability in the policy process.</li>

  <li>Official recognition of persons with disability is restricted to individuals with persons with a disability guide, which forms the basis all national statistical data in the national report. According to this definition, the proportion of disabled males stands at 5.62% of the total male population, and women with disabilities account for 4.27% of the total female population. This is far lower than the global average which stands at around 10%.</li>

  <li>According to the Act to Implement the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability, (hereafter the “CRPD Implementation Act”), the government is responsible for screening and comparing existing laws and executive orders with the CRPD. However, as most government departments still lack comprehension and training concerning the issues, the required screening and monitoring work stipulated under the Implementation Act has not been implemented effectively.</li>

  <li>Not only the central government lacks a comprehensive understanding of the CRPD principles, government authorities at the local level have even less understanding and awareness of the content of CRPD. This results in local laws and regulations, special laws, or administrative regulations enacted by local governments or departments (such as prison) have a very high risk of violating the provisions in the CRPD and the domestic People with Disabilities Rights Protection Act (“the Rights Act”) without even being aware of it.</li>

  <li>The government's understanding on accessibility is limited to the physical environment. The barrier-free accessibility policy on existing buildings only cover some specifically nominated buildings and not all existing government buildings.</li>

  <li>The overall resources (including policy formation, financial and resource allocation) provided by the   government are insufficient, leading to difficulties in removing existing obstacles in society, and people with disabilities are often unable to obtain sufficient support. In 2016, for example, the government allocated TWD4,671 billion for social welfare expenditure and TWD13.3 billion for the persons with disabilities, accounting for only 0.66% of the total government budget for the year. According to the survey in 2013, there were 7,575 social workers in the country, of whom only 1,230 specialized in working with persons with mental and physical disabilities.</li>

  <li>The government does not provide a holistic support assessment centered on the persons with disabilities. It only passively accepts individual requests for personal services from the Persons with Disabilities, thereby fragmenting the services provided, making it difficult to meet the needs of Persons with Disabilities.</li>

  <li>The government has not yet recognized the importance of reasonable adjustment in the implementation of the rights of Persons with Disabilities, nor does it require employers or service providers the obligation to provide reasonable adjustment.</li>

  <li>Many of the relevant laws, including the Rights Act, can be seen only as an aspirational declaration and not enforceable, lacking concrete implementation and monitoring mechanism. For example, the lack of enforcement rules, unclear in justiciability, high entry barrier and costs for appeals / litigation, lack of penalties, etc. Officials who deal with appeals often take a mediation manner and conciliatory approach, with little use of penalties.</li>

  <li>Although the government has set up the Committee for the Promotion of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities under the Executive Yuan after the enactment of the Implementation Act, the work of the Committee has not been effective and the Committee is unable to work on issues across different government agencies.  Similar limitation and inadequacy also impedes the work of similar Committees being set up by local governments.</li>

  <li>Government have not implemented comprehensive assessment of their policies, laws and social services to determine their impact on people with disabilities and to ensure their right to equal participation and have their specific needs addressed. We recommend the Government should carry out comprehensive Disability Impact Assessment in the early stages of policy-making and legislatively process.</li>
