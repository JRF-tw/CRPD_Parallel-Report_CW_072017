## Article 23 Respect for home and family

### People with disabilities do not receive appropriate fertility and family planning education (in response to Paragraphs 170, 192 of the State Report:)

<ol start="164">
  <li><p>The Government merely describes services provided for women's reproductive health (mainly subsidies for prenatal screening and fertility regulation) but has not been able to provide concrete plans to provide vital family planning education catering to people with disabilities in accordance to article 23, Paragraph 1 of the CRPD. This makes it difficult to ensure that people with disabilities are well equipped to “freely and responsibly form decisions on family planning”. Specifically, what educational resources and support measures are provided by the Government to ensure the protection of People with disabilities of their rights to fertility and family life? (Refer to Article 17, Paragraph 142-143, and Article 10, Paragraphs 93-94.)</p></li>
</ol>

### The government does not provide assistance to People with disabilities in raising children

<ol start="165">
  <li><p>People with Disabilities do not receive relevant support in the process of child rearing. Existing policies and services do not incorporate support for People with disabilities, including the provision of relevant support services (such as personal assistant support), care of young children (feeding, washing diapers, bathing) and other related aids.</p></li>

  <li><p>Due to discriminatory attitudes about the ability of People with Disabilities in raising children, children of people with disabilities are more likely to be discriminated against and/or forcibly removed from their homes by social welfare personnel. It is suggested that the government surveys and compares the home replacement statistics, including number, proportion and gender, of children with parents with disabilities to that of regular families.</p></li>
